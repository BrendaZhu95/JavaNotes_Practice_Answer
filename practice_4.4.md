## Question 

4. This exercise builds on Exercise 4.3. Every time you roll the dice repeatedly, trying to<br/>
get a given total, the number of rolls it takes can be different. The question naturally<br/>
arises, whatâ€™s the average number of rolls to get a given total? Write a function that<br/>
performs the experiment of rolling to get a given total 10000 times. The desired total is<br/>
162 CHAPTER 4. SUBROUTINES<br/>
a parameter to the subroutine. The average number of rolls is the return value. Each<br/>
individual experiment should be done by calling the function you wrote for Exercise 4.3.<br/>
Now, write a main program that will call your function once for each of the possible totals<br/>
(2, 3, ..., 12).<br/>

## Note
The answer code is for custermized times and given total.<br/>
If we only need no more than 5 tests to calculate an average, it will show all dice results and <br/>
tell counts of everytime; if it's more than 5 tests, it would be too many printings on the screen, <br/>
so the program will only tell the final results of total counts and average counts.
